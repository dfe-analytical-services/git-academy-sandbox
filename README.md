# git-academy-sandbox

This is a sandbox repository for analysts to use with the [DfE git academy](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/git-academy/) materials.

# Using the sandbox

When using the sandbox for L&D, please start by creating your own personal main branch using your GitHub username as a prefix, e.g.:

```
git checkout -b rmbielby/main
```

You can also view examples of this naming convention, and create a new branch, on the [branches page for this repository](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox/branches).

All subsequent work should be performed on branches based on the same naming convention. Any branches not conforming to this convention will be removed during periodic clean ups.
